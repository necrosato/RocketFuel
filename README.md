<b>Rocket Fuel</b> is a small, easy to use app that sits discreetly in your menu bar awaiting your command. One simple click <b>prevents</b> your Mac from going to <b>sleep</b> or <b>dimming</b> its display.

With version 2.0, RocketFuel is written entirely in Swift.

Features:
- One Click Activation
- Auto Launch on Startup
- Deactivate After a Preset Time
- Works with Dark Mode in Yosemite
- Support for AppleScript

New in version 2.1:
- You can now add custom hot keys to enable/disable Rocket Fuel.
- You can also set a minimum battery level at which Rocket Fuel automatically disables.
- Your Deactivation Preset Time is not saved between activations (not launches, though).
- More AppleScript commands.
- Minor bug fixes and more improvements.

Requires:
- OS X Yosemite (10.10) or later.
